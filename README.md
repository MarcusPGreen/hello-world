Nothing much to say here. I'm just typing some stuff so I can continue with the tutorial. I really should be doing this from the command line, but I'm super incompetent right now, so I'm using this to get a basic sense of what I'm doing first.

If you want to use radar.js for some reason, it needs to be loaded into a page that has a canvas with the same name as whatever value you pass to the function (battlefield by default). It also needs to be at the end of the page because it doesn't wait for document ready before calling functions that require the canvas to already exist.
